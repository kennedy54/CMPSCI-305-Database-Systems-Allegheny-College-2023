# Five Research Questions

# Tugi Gantulga, David Gormley, Ryan Kennedy

## Question 1

* Explain What is the research question?

How many parts are considered to be defective, and how many parts are considered to be not defective? How many defective parts were used for destructive testing, and how many not defective parts were used for destructive testing?

* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

We would need the data on what is considered to be defective and not defective, specifically the color of the tags of the parts/products.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

This question can help us determine how often parts are deemed as defective which would relate to wasted materials. Knowing this information could also help in making a solution that would decrease the quantity of defective parts.

## Question 2

* Explain What is the research question?

How many JobIDs were the most and least efficient in the process of creating parts/products for aerospace vehicles? What particular JobID's were the most and least efficient?

* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

We would need the JobIDs and use the Job table to see how each of them as contributed in the process of making, ordering, picking, shipping, or returning the parts/products.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

This question can ensure how many, and which specific JobIDs can be relied on in the future of the company to complete tasks in the process of making, ordering, picking, shipping, or returning the parts/products for aerospace vehicles. It can also see what JobIDs are underperforming, leading the company to make a decision to not use these types of JobIDs any further.

## Question 3

* Explain What is the research question?

Are there any trends in the "Make_Quantity," "Order_Quantity," and "Shipped_Quantity" over time based on the "Sched_Start" and "Sched_End" dates in the "job" table?

* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

We would need the data mentioned above located in the "Make_Quantity," "Order_Quantity," "Shipped_Quantity," "Sched_Start," and "Sched_End" columns in the job table.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

This question can help us figure out the difference in make and order quantity to see how often materials are wasted. This question can also help us find out trends in the order and shipped quantity to see on what dates they were the most efficient and what days they had a high workload.

## Question 4

* Explain What is the research question?

How can the data from these tables be used in a warehouse or for business intelligence purposes?

* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

The data we would need to answer this question would include all information on the orders (dates, amount, etc) as well as include information on materials and how often they were wasted.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

The business can use the data extracted from these queries to detirmine a way to waste less materials through trends relating to the wasted materials. Warehouses can use this data to better organize their warehouses and ensure all orders are where they belong.

## Question 5

* Explain What is the research question?

What impact does query design have on response time? if any?

* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

We could use any data in the database but we would need to ensure that the query returns a large quantity of data in order to get an accurate measurement on whether or not changing the way the query is written effects response time.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

Although these questions don't specifically relate to wasted materials or identify a trend, we can use the result of this research question to improve efficinecy when trying to identify trend or inquire about wasted materials.
